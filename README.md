# Prework - Prework Codepath

Submitted by: Jehanzaib Khaliq

Prework Codepath is an app that... changes color after pressing a button

Time spent: 1 hour spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] Users are see a screen with three labels and a button
- [X] Tapping the button changes the screen color to a random color


## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

Instagram -- reels, groupchats

Clash of Clans -- clan wars, clan chat

LinkedIn -- Posting, Connecting

An improvement I would add to any of these 3 apps is adding a global chat. I believe the ability to talk to anyone is great (Clash of Clans used to have this but they removed it). It is a great way to build a community and get to know new people.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

struggled with the button activating, creating a change in the color of the background.
